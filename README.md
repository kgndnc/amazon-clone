## Amazon Clone with React

Here's a link to the --> [site](https://clone-2b9d7.web.app/)

In this project I build an Amazon clone which has the basic e-commerce website functionalities such as signing in, signing up, shopping cart, payment (with Stripe), listing previous orders and so on.

<br />

- For frontend React and for backend Node.js and Cloud Functions for Firebase were used.

- For state management React Context Api was used.

- Authentication and authentication state management handled with Firebase. You can signup with your email or use your Google account.

- Users and their order histories are stored in Firestore Database. Security rules added to Firestore to prevent unauthorized access to users and orders resources.

- Stripe is used for payment processing.
